            <p>
              StockOverFlow is an advanced inventory management software
              designed to help businesses efficiently track and manage their
              stock. Aimed at businesses of all sizes, the platform streamlines
              inventory processes, reduces waste, and provides real-time
              insights into inventory levels, sales trends, and demand
              forecasting.
            </p>

            <h3>Challenge</h3>

              updates, and was scalable to meet the growing demands of their
              business. The system also had to be user-friendly and integrate
              with other business systems.
